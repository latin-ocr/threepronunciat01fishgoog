, ψ bility for the prevalenoe at that time among the edu·
eated of a sound which conjecture ean represent no
better than by that which the German scholare have
adopted; the sound, namely‚ of their own oe (nearly
the Frenoh ea in fleur).

“Thus the oe in proellum would sound nearly like ο
in English world, or i in English wnirlss’ (Blair, pp.
lib-64.) ·

An examinatior of these extraots from the argu-
ments of those who favor the innovation will show that
the position of the writer, as to the basis on which the

· so·oalled Roman system is founded, is faot. The rea-
son for prononnoing y always as 9 in pet may be
regarded by some as valid and decisivo. This letter is

, ably treated by Roby‚ Censen, and others. Thato
' was always like lc is not without difficulty and differ·
enee of opinion. This may be inferred from the quo
tations already cited. That there is a real differeuoe
of opinion among those who favor reform in England
is perfeotly olear from a statement made by Pros· Max
Miiller. (Academyffleo 15, 1871.) He says: “As I
looked upon a reform in the English pronunciation of
vowels as far more important than any improvement in
the pronunciation of certain consonante, my ohief object
was to show that some eompromise might be possible
in regard to o, and that, in allowing their weaker breth-
ren some liberty in the pronunciation of this one letter ’
before iaud e, thoroughgoing reformers need not have
felt ashamed‚ as is saorifioiug an important principle.”
The weaker brethren referred to are those who do not
feel inclined to pronouneee like ic, before e, i, p, oe, oe,
and eu. Some of their reasons are given in the oon·
spectus on the lettere already quoted.
