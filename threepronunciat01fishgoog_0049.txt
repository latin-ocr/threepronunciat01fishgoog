Bullions' Greek Grammar by Kendrick, au ardent
advocate 01 the Erasmian system, virtually yields the
point that we do not know the ancient pronunciation.
00 page 4 000010 the following passage : -

“ The ancient pronunciation 011110 Greek vowels aud
diphthongs cannot now be determined with certainty in
011 00000. The knowledge we have 01 11 10 derived

chiefly from Greek words that appear in Latin aud ⁴

Latin words that appear in Greek, from imitation 01
natural sounds, astho bleating 01 sheep or the barking
01 the dog; from a play upon words, and other sim·
ilar hints. Valuable aid may be derived from the pro·

nunciation 01 the modern Greek, and 0 study 01 the ,

euphonia laws which have produced it.

‘⁶ If uniformityiu the pronunciation 01 the Greek is 10 ’

be aimed at‚- and it is certainly desirable that it

should, -the Erasmian method, among all others now =

in use, seems entitled 10 preference, on account oi 110
⁴ simplicity and perspicuity, and 00 having largely in 110
favor the authority of the ancients. It is the pronun·
0101100 mainly prevalent iu Europe, and 10 0 considera·
ble extent iu America.’'

It is well known by scholars that Sophocles, Packard,
Curtius, aud Kiihner‚ not 10 mention others, do not
yet agree 00 10 the sounds 01 some 01 the diphthongs.
Erasmus never claimed anything more than that the
system indicated in the dialoguc was an approximatiou
to the ancient pronunciation.
