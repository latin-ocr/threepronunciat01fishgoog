under an able teaoher, who understands the English
pronunciation 81 Latin, as he ought, let them study the
grand old langnage 'of Cicero, and we shall have
scholars who know how to 188 their own wonderful lan-
guage. Erery lesson the student learns has a reilex

everylesson, 'every sound, every association leads away
from the vernacular. In 88888 81 this kind 1118 cru·

Here we are glad to have 81 hand a 181181 from the
accomplished scholar and veteran educator, Proi. E. T.
Kemper, 81 Boonville, Mo. This letter has such direct
bearing upon the English method 81 pronounoing Latin

181 accuracy 81 English scholarship, as 18 make any '

additional remarks unnecessary under this head.

valuehighly the Roman method 8188. No other exer·
8188 88 fixes the attention 81 young and thoughtless'
minds, and secures such accuracy 81 mental habits. A

then the rules come into use not only throughout school
and college life, but in almost every casual 88118188-
1181. Why, 181 example, the first α 11 8811881 and
sardonyx are prononnoed so differently, or the second a
in Samaria and Samariten, are hut specimens of what
is always needed, and what our publio speakers 811811
do not know.”
