two cognate tongues. No two natione have ever had

We fix attention on the fact that the phonetic system of ’ ,

the old Greeks is not known, that the modern does not

at least in large part, confessedly lost for ages.

There is another fact that may tend to strengthen

“right reason ” on this point. Erasmus, a scholar of ,-
