“ Here we have the 9 and the eused interohangeably‚
showing that they had nearly the same sound before i.
Either both were hard or both were soit. If both were
hard, then the Italians, as well as the French and
Spaniards, are entirely wrong in their pronunciation of
both letters, and the same ineorreotness isto be found
in mestos the English words derived from the Latin
in the use of the y. In fact, all the world is wrong
exoept the Germane. Is it, however, probable that all
these natione should wrongly pronounoe all the Latin
words which still exist anchanged in their languages
in whioh either eor y precedes e and i; and that the
Choreh. carrying on daily and continuously its fonctions
and offioes in Latin for eighteen centuries, should have
assumed a totally new and false pronunciation?

“If thisbe the case, what is to be made of the ob-
servation of Quintilian, “Cum an similitier G non
valuerunt in T ae D, molliuntur; ne illas quidem eirea
S literam delitias [whieh‚ be it observed, he spells
delitias] hio magister feret''i (Inst, lib. i., eap. 11.)

¹* Other exemplos are to be found in the royal ediotswherey
and e are used interchangeably, as having the same ioroe. Thus,
agnum is spelled aenum3 agrum, aerum, ete.
