aocents? Consistency would require this. But we have
fought that battle once and won it, and the worthy
professor must imitate his Southern brethren, and abide
by the results of the war. Again, how many of these
fourteen thousand proper names are important from
their frequent occurrence? Probably not two hundred.
If the Pupil, when he meets any of these two hundred
in his Latin text, is required, in translating, to use the
English pronunciation, and this is at present the pre-
vailing practice, he will, if English analogice aid him,

pronouuce them correctly without further assistance.
If English analogies do not aid him, he will learn the

Alexander, Alexandri‘a. In the case of names that
occur but rarely, and that may fairly be assumed to be
unfamiliar to the ordinary pupil, he must either con·

run the rislr of givinga false accent. But if hc must
consult his dictionary to determine the place of accent,
what is to prevent him from noting, at the same time,

But what force has this answer to our position?
Let us see. The first statement is that “the more
troublesome half, probably,’' of these proper names

thc correctness of the assertion and suppose that even
eight thousand of these words are Greek. Now then,
