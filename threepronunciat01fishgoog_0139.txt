nearly forty years, and is, in the West, what Phillips
s Academy is in New Englaud. More accurate training ,
is not found in America. The e'xperience os this able > ’ 3
toacher corresponds with that of Arnold, of Rugby, ,
and of the accomplished Jex-Blake, who now fills
Amold’s place. Aecuracy in English is in value above
rubies, and is seldom attained. Many who have taught>
the English method have evidently never mastered the
subject. For example, a writer in the “ N ew Englaud
Journal of Education,” for Dec. 26, 1878, uses this
sentence: “ Again, diphthongs are long in quantity,
but the genitive of Oaesar we call Caesaris (Sezaris).''
He gives the a the a sound in an oblique case. Does it
not have the hissing sound iu the oblique cases? Do
nottho authorities sayso? So we thinla *How many . κ
teachers can give the reason why a in Sareeea and aar·
donym are not alike? How many can tell why o in
Samaria differs from a in Samaritani Such examples
are of constant recurrence, and while the student learns Δ
carefully the English mode, he at the sometime learns
the more elegant way to prouounce his own language.
,Mark you, the English system, at the same time the -
class learns to prououuce Latin, gives as a necessary
consequence the most valuable aid in etymology, and.
‘ also in English orthoepy. Hence the English method
economizes time, while the socalled Roman mode kills
· the time, sacrifices the etymology, and completely
revolutionizes the orthoepy.
We¹ hear frequently from our best educated publio
speakers and from many a teacher's desk mistakes which
a rigid drilling in the use of the English pronunciatiou
would have prevented. Thus derivation, meaning, and
pronunciation favor decidedly the system that has been
employed in Englaud since the reign of Elizabeth.
