7003 pro, 600; per, 350. From the single root foc we
have about 604 derivatives, according-to Prof. Halde·
man. (See his “ Afflxes‚’' ppt 14-16.)

The author last quoted is of the opinion that there

{ . are not three hundred roots in any language. (‘· Affixe3,'’

p. 13.) In view oi the faot that suoh a vast ma-
jority of our words are srom the Latin, either mediately
or immediately, in view of the saut that of these three

Eiifixes and stems whieh make our English what it is.
. It matters ”not-whether the English system of pronoun·

, cing Latin hasbeen used one hundred years, three hun·

dred years, or one thousand years: what we are oon-
eerned with is tham-he English language as it is now

For centuries the Latin has been making its rieh
contributione to our noble English. These additions
’ to our language are being made to-day, as they will be

of inestimable value to every student is a thorough ἶ
knowledge of his mother tongue‚ —a matter sadly neg·
leeted in many of our eolleges and universities ⁵
The question for English-speaking people to settle is
as to whioh pronunciation leads most direotly to a vig·
orous and thorough use of our mother tongue. We .
answer unhesitatingly, the English. Let us have one '
’ thing ata time. The bearing of the new pronuncia·
tion on comparative philology will receive due attention
