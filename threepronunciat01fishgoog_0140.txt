· there are not less than fourteen thousand found in our
large dictionaries. These names are pronounced. not
alter the Continental meth0d‚ much less aiter the doubt·
fully resurrected meth0d; but in all cases atter the
Walkerian or English system. This is a consideration
os vast importance. ·Α class taught the “hard’' or
Roman mode of pronunciation will, in multitudes of
instaures, eall these names wrong. This is daily obvi-
ous to any instructor who uses the Latin method, more

standard authority. The English pronunciation brings

classical words have been omitted in the most recent
editions of our great dictionaries. The omission ern-
braces monosyllables, a large number of dissyllables‚ ·
, words of rare occurrence, and many fictitious names

found in the poets. The number of classica] names is ’

wastly larger than a mere passing acquaintance might
lead scholare tc suppose. The best reply to this argu-
ment for the English mode is taken from a recent
writer on the side of the hard method :-

“In the first place, how many os these 14‚000
proper names are Greek, and not Latin at all? The
more troublesome half, probably. Would Dr. Fisher
have us reverse his argument, and going back for the
sake of these Greek proper names twenty-five years,
revive the old pronunciation of Greek, with its English

sounds of the vowels and its disrcgard of the written .
