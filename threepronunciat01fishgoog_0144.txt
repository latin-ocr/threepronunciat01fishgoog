But, say the new Romans, if boys must look for the
length oi the penult in order to iix the⁸accent, why can't
they at the same time note “the marks that indicate the
proper vowel and consonant sounds''? We reply that
they can't do it, because the dictionaries do not give
any such marks to show vowel and consonant sounds in
proper names. The place of the accent is marked aud
that is all. The English student does not need them;

disabled and disqualified for his work in interpreting the
words in our dictionaries. If such marks were used,

studento, after the reformed method, could not or ’

would not apply them. This is not all yet. The
reformer says, “ and I do not believe that· our English
speech would suffer materially‚ if his whole system
should be supplanted by one more rational.''

of pronouncing proper names. What more rational
system do they propose? Would these scholars drag
our English language, which forms so large and essen

but living facts, every-day facts. In proper names the
English is infinitely to be preferred3 the so-called
