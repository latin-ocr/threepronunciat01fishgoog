purely phonetic spelling, there is avital and indissolu-
ἐ hle connection between the sound and its sign. For

' 'over a quanter 010 century, some 010111 ablest scholare

’ have given much time and great learning to the prep-
aration 01 such 011 alphabet. What is the result?
No such alphabet has been agreed on, and there are
three “ schemcs 01 10101111,” each 01 which finds able
advocates: 1. Some favor the use 01 “new signs''
altogether3 2. Others, the Roman “letters with Ro·
man values ”3 3. Others still insist on ί(1010111100-
cording 10 English analogies.’' (See March's address ·
before the International Convention 101 the Amend-
‚ment 01 Orthography, Philadelphia‚ 1876.) Prof.
March says: ‘⁶ For my part, Ι do not regard 11 as a wild
vision 10 imagine such an alphabet in the future. But
it is obvious that any such system must wln its way
very slowly, first 11110 coordinate use with the Roman
alphabet, and 01101 0 struggle 01 many generations, to
its displacement3 so that the improvement 01 our
present alphabet is still 10 be desired while it 10010.”Ι
This quotation from this distinguished scholar hints 01
existing obstacles, and indicates his opinion as to the
best way 01 amending English orthography.

Look again at the various systems 01 stenographic ,= ·
signs. These 01 Μ1. Ρ11111011, Bishop Wilkins, and Mr. ‚s
Bell are best known. Nohody claims that they are s
alike. Obviously, they are remarkably unlihe, and
yet 011 three are labored, prolonged, and learned
attempts to set 101111 by signs the sounds 01 our own
English. But take the system 01 Μ1. Pitman, which
has undergone such radical changes in a quanter 01 0
century that those, I am told, who learned it then, are
at sea in the use 01 the same system as now taught, and .

are reduced 10 the necessity 01 acquiring it in order to
