the masterly understanding of our etymology a duty

“But,” replies Prof. W. G. Richardson, “the eye
Χ has quite asmuch to do as the ear, perhaps more.'' He
virtually admits that the phonetic methodos proncon-
cing Latin is a barren lig-tres in etymology, when the
sound is considered, but the eye, he thinks, may relieve
, ¹the oase and make his new mode tolerable. From what ’

s

source do young people learn most of language in pro·
nunciation, if not also in meaning? We might answer, ¹
By the ear. But in the present case we answer, that in
the use of the English pronunciation in its relationto
*our etymology, the ear is wholly on our side and the
‘¹ eye is as much on our side as on his-3 nsy, more, for
κ’ the hard pronunciation of the Latin makes a chasml
’ between what the ear hears and what the eye sees on l, ,
the printed page. “
Prof. Tetlow, coming to the aid of his able friend,
says, ‘⁶ This appeal to the eye, moreover, is quite suffi-
cient to render obvious the derivation.’' ( ·‘ N ew Eng-
land J ournal,'' N ov. 29.) He is writing of the deriva-
tion of English words. Very well. The eye ia suffi-
cient to the task‚ and if all American and English boys
were comparative philologieis, there might be force in ⁹
the argument os Mr. Tetlow. The* question is not,
what is sufficient to show the derivation of English
words? but, what system of Latin pronunciationis of
most value in English etymology. what system shows
Ι the derivation most naturally, easily, and univcrsally?
Asking such a question is at once an emphatic answer ⁶
in behals oi the system that “ reigns unquestioned'’ at
Oxl'ord and Cambridge, llngland.
