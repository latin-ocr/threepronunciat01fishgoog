in the Latin tonguo. (Bouwier's Law Dictionary‚ Vol.
11. p. 15.) Since English was made the language of
the courts, a vast number oi technioal terms and
phrases, in the original Latin, have continued in use,
The law books abound with them. Ever since the
Tudor age, the great jurists in England have used the
English pronunciation in their pleading. They do it
today. For generations the same has been true in
America. Webster, Everett, Choate, and others knew
no other in their practice. If Blaokstone were in· court
today, and some jurist should oallfor a scire faciae and
pronounoe it sicce-ray sotlec-obs, he would be puzzled;
or if the ·pleader should quote the maxim, alcarius noa
babel uicarium, and pronounce it aee-kon-ree-oos adae
hah-bal mee-kcb-reeoom, he would never recognize the
maxim. The Roman pronunciation would confuse
every English court in the world, if for no other reason
because it is so totally at variance with established
usage. In law, then, consistency requires the old
mode.

As a further illustration oi the change the socalled
Roman method would make in the legal profession,
take certiorari, which becomes leugadie-drohn&
