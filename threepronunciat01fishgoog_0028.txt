then, prevailing in Western Europe and our own country,
five are strictly attonat. Their differences find at orme
¹ an original and an explanation in the fact that the
scholars of each nation have followed, in their pronun·
ciations of Latin, the analogias of their own vernacu-
lars In this way, while making sure of mutual disa- ¹
greement, ull have departed more or loss from the true
Roman method, and the whole subject has been in-
volved in uncertainty and confusion. Meanwhile the
pseudo-Continental system, destitute alike of historical '
dignity and scientific aecuracy, and lacking even the
poor support of national prejudice and pride, is power·
less to mediate and compose these differences. Although
it undoubtedly avoids some of the grossest absurdities
peculiar to the English system, it laoks the elements
which command respect, and oan never establish a claim

Pronunoiations of Latin‚'' says: “ Mr. Fisher cites, for
instance, the proper name Cicera, and shows that the
ItalianS, the French, the Spaniards, and the Germans
differ from one another as widely as from the English.

Hungary, wherein, and not exclusivcly in ecclesiastical
affaim, Latin remained a living language after it had
disappuarcd from general use everywhere else in Chris-
tendom. In Maria Theresa’s time the deliberations of
the Diet were in Latin, and within the present gener·
ation it was spoken freely in the homes of tho wealth·
ier and better educated classes. The pronunciation
differed ta toto from all those cited in' the pamphlet, and
it is certainly as likely to have been as nearly like that
