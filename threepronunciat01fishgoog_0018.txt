The true theory of this methodis that tho vowels had!
hutone sound. ⁷

⁴* Soholars who attempt to represent the short vowels
by English equivalents, do it thus ε -

i=a in past. 6=o in obey.
ὅτε in pet. ir=u in pull.
i=i in pit, or ratify. γεῆι] in sur (Frenoh).

To sound‘ y, put the mouth in the oo position, and
say, ee.

DIPHTHONGS.

In pronounoing diphthongs‚ let each vowel hove its
own sound. Let the utteranoe be rapid.

ae=aye=English i. en=eh·oo; or ew in fe'w.
an=ou in onr. oe=oi in eoil.
ei =ei in rein. ui=ni in snite, or=we (oo-ee).

The consonante are pronounoed asin English, with
seven exceptions ε -

o=k. t is hard ;'=t in hat.

g=g in get. v=w in wine ; vioi=wee·kee.
j=y3 jam=yam. r must be trilletl3 =r in serry.

sounded. Consnlt the grammars of Bartholomew and

Gildersleeve.

remarks: ‘⁶ Tho short sonnis are only less prolonged in pronuncio·
v tion than the long sounds, and have no exart English equivalents.”
