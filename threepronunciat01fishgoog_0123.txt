' We pronounce here the combinations ue and oe pre-
ζ cisely in the same way, giving them always the scund
l of ain the English word mute. This supposes them to
l be combined, as otherwise each letter receives its full
scund. (For example the word (ter.) The combina-
tion aa is so pronounced as to give their native value
to each of the concurring vowels, but witha slight
stress on the' n. The result is a scund almost the
same as that given to the ow in the English word hom.
The letter j has always the scund of pin the English·
'’wcrd yea. The lettere is pronounced in the same way
as in Italian. Before the combinations aa and ω, it ,
retains the sonnd it has before i and e. Also the letter
pis pronounced here as it is in Italian. Before the,
combination ω, which is not found in Italian, it retains
the softer scund, which it has before e and f. The let· ,
“ ter u is pronounced invariably as it is in Italian. The
words, then, which you mentioned as examples ¹(niact't,
Cicero, paupino) are pronounced, as 'far as the letters .
agree, like the Italian words tanolfi, Cicerone, and
penqlua. ι

giving you information as to the way, in general, Latin
and Greek are pronounced‚I limit my explanation tc
the way in which we pronounce Latin in our Italian
schools, and particularly the letters and combinations ἢ
alludcd to in your letter.
