5. Thesweeping change advocated by the neu pro·

nunciation tends to a complete revolution in the pro·

nunciation of our own langnage. Professor Thecher‚ « ;

onale College, uses the following language ι ·“ For, to
speak of Latin words which we have adopted, how long
will Cicero maintain his place in English pronunciation
aiter the rod shall have banished him from the lips of
all Anglo·Saxon boys and girls who thumb the little
Latin histories of the men of Rome, and shall have
substituted the classical nee-tanc in his place? How
long will Caesar stand against Kaisar, Scipio against
Skee-peeo‚ Fabricius against Fah-bree-keelooa Cyrus
against Keeroos, Tacitus against Taketoos, and so on
through a long list of proper names which make a,
familiar part of our English language. Ρνίαηα sucle‘
evidence will become preemah iahkeeah evidence, the
quid pro quo, keed pro co; the penius loct, aganes-
oos lokee3 the mena conscio, a mdns conskeeah (o as .
in eone); scillcet, skeeleekr‘at3 et cetera, at katarah3' ’

Let o be pronounced like w, and note the way the
most common expressions will he transformed ε -’ ·

eico uoce becomes theotochon-leeg.
per centurn “ ptr lenae-loom.
jure divino “ poc-ray dee-weeeto.
jus etoile ‘⁶ yoos decesso-luy.
vahalim “ anyer-balucem.
oiootrepiaa “ aee-wall roy-peccat.

And hopeless confusion is madeof the many Latin
words incorporated into English, as utile dulce must be
oo-ree-lny doolcw ‚⁰

cole, woh-luy.
vioe uerso, uec-hay meyer-ant. ,
