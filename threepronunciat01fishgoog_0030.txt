sively in private ciroles, even so late as the beginning
of the present century, was quite as peculiar to the
nation in question as any one of the five modern
tongues before mentioned. ἱ
Before passing to the next point, let attention be
carefully fixed on several facts indisputably settled:
1. That no phase of the Continental system of Eu·
ropc professes to be the true ancient pronunciation3
2. That no two of thern agree in the sonnds of the con·
k sonants3 3. That the socalled Roman pronunciation
does not agree with a single one of them in either
vowels or consonante-as, for instance, Cicer0, pro·
nounced Krete-ro, certainly differs from the French
’ Sec-scyro, the Italian Olea-chayro, the Spanish Thec-
lhap-ro and the German Tseel-soy-ro; 4. That the s
socelled Roman differs more widely from the Italian r
than from the other Romanae tongues, -a fact not a Χ ·
little significant when we remember that the Italian is ’
’ spoken on the very soil rendered almost sacred to the f
scholar by the hallowed memories of thejLatin language3 s
5. That when Americans use the Continental they do
uot sound the consonants lilre any nation 'or tribe lon
the continent of Europe. They approximate the vowel
sounds of the Continent, but almost invariably pro-
nounce the consonauts as in English. Hence the
so-called Continental of America is a combination of
foreign vowel sounds with consonants uttered almost
