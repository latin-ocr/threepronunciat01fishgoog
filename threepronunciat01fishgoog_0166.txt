“Paor. Frsnnn:
'⁴‘ My Dour ura-1 have read your pamphlet (first

edition) on Latin Pronunoiation, which you were kind
enough to hand me afew days since, and leel constrained
to make aformal and explicit aoknowledgment of my
obligations to you for it.

discovered, and Ι have not e'xactly known which, sinos
my academie undergraduate days, wherein it was my

01 statement, explanation, refutation, and argument,
that even alayman may venture to arise from the perusal
01 your pamphlet with a pretty deeided because intelli·

‘rest 01 11 unsettled and inadequate foundation,’
(page 11), and still further and positively, as you ex-
press it on page 23, ‘that for English-speaking people
the English pronunciation is the best!
