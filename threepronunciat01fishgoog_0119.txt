Dear Sir. -The reformed method of Latin pronun·
ciation has been introduced into this school to onlya
limited extent. In the sixth— onr highest form - the
boys are required to conform to the rules drawn up by
1110 Latin professore in the universities of Oxford and
Cambridge, in sayn'ng their repetition lessous. With

, this exception, Latin is pronounced here in the manner

which has so long been usual in English schools. I
believe that head masters generally in this country,
although there was some hesitation 101 a time, have ι
now acquiesoed in the continuance of the established
method os pronouncing Latin. For my own part I
should have been glad to comply strictly with the rules
drawn up by the professore of Latin, ir other head

masters wouldhave agreedto make the change, and is ⁴

tutors and lecturers at Oxford and Cambridge had not

adhered 10 the received method. Ina matter of this

kind, uniformity of practice is obviously desirable. ι
Believe me, dear sir,

Yours very faithfully,
H. W. Moss.

To 1110 Professor os Latia tutte Universae os Mtaacari:

, Ρ. S. Yon may make any use of this letter that you
think fit.

Oxronn, Brennum, Sept. 3, 1878.

· Deur sta-1 arn ashamed to see that your letter of
the 2511011000, in this year, hasbeen so long neg· ¹
lected. I have really nothing to add to my letter 'of
1876. The subject of Latin pronunciation has attracted
vlittle attention in England during the two past years.
