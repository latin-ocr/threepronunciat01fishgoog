“It would seem, therefore, all things considered,
that there is not sufficient warrant to overthrow the

present Italian pronunciation oi c and p, as recommended

in the Ocscrd aad Cambridge syllabus. Nothing cer·
tainly is gained, variety is sacrificed, and there seems
to be every probability that the traditional pronuncia·
tion is right. Atell events, such is the universal pro·
nunciation in the south of Europe.

⁴⁴ Agaim when we consider the large number of pure
Latin words still in constant use in Italy, without change,
so many of which are names of things and materiale
in common use-words which hare been constantly

ter p was unknown in Rome for five centurias, and was first intro·
duoed into use by the grammarian spurius Garuilus, in the year
540 (about 213 Β. 0.). Though this mustbeamistake‚ as it appears
ln the Duillian inscription oi 494, and also ln the epitaph oi Scipio
Barbatus, who was consul in 456, yet it is plain that it must have
beenor intraquent use, or hc would not have made such astatement.
In macistratus, Cartacinensia Lectores, cxiociont, cand ywere
apparently equivalents in scandas they would be ir pronounccd
as the Itallans now pronounce tham, the difference being what in
English lies between “chin ’' and “gin’' Had they pronounced
both these letters hard. they could easily have used the letterlc
(since they were misspelling these words), which was already in
the alphabet, and appears in a bronnetablet in the Barbetini Library
at the ‹lateoi the beginning oi the fourth century of Rome - “sub
oede hostoria.”

Again, ln late excavations at Ostia tha following inscription was
found oi the early Christian times: -

“ Loc. Aphrodisias, cum deus permicerit‚
Calius hlc dormit, et Dacrla, quando deus
Boluerit”

From a passage in Ausonius it would ewen seem that c had more
the sound oi a than oi lc, ior without this pronunciation the J'est
would bs lost. Venus says oi herself, ‘⁸ Nata salo, suscepta solo,
patre edita coe10.'' Ii the c be here pronounced as lc, the play upon
wordsis lost. So also ceu, acu, aive, point to this pronunciation.
