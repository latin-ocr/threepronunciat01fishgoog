What are we to say of this word gingiber, which was
also spelled zinziber- our English ginger? There can
be no doubt that the a was soit, at least if we can trust
Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Fabius. Again, the
Latine sometimes put D for G, showing that it was
soit. Were the Germane ever called the Ghermans?
Why, too, was it ever necessary to spell the Greek cbc'
with ch, if (lhad the same hard sound? Why Cheru-
bini, and chiragra, and Chelidonia, and Chiromantis‚
and Chelae, and others? How, too, are we to pro·

1 nounce words in which c follows c, as excire, excipio,

elided3 if hard, this would scarcely be possible. So
again, how are 'we to explain the fact that such names
as Valentia and Sulpitia are written Valencia and Sul·
picia3 end conditio and solatium appear as condicio
and solacium?⁴l Again, why spell pulcher with an b,
ii pulcer has the same sound?

“There is still another clear indication that p had

the Roman alphabet to express various distinction of ’
soumis, proposed to introduce three new letters or char·
acters, one oi which was called the anti-sigma, which
was formed by reversing one c against another. This
oc represented the function of the Greek psi, and all
three letters were, in the opinion et least oi Priscian
and Quintilian, necessary. If, therefore, the sound of
cformed any part of that of pst, it clearly could not
have been hard like lr.† ’
