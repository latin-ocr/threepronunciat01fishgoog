vato. In words of more than two syllables, the Penult,
if lonp, is accented3 if the Penult is show, the Ante·
penult is accented; as, mla-di'ctiardestti-eds, ἅδην-ῖ-
nita, vot-teau

There are three exceptione to the rule given:

1. Genitives of the Second Declension in ῑ for ii,
and Vocatives of the same Declension ini for te, acoent
a short Penult; as, faed-ai for tuydam Vir-peti
for Vir-priter.

2. Fet-cio retains its own accent when compounded
with any word except a preposition3 as, eom-moac-
fet-cit.

3. Α short final syllable followed by an enclitic η

receives the accent3 as, quid-ac. This last exception
Α applies to all three systems of pronunciation.

Here we must be allowed tc dissentirem the rule
laid down by nearly all grammarians, namely, that a
short syllable followedby an enclitic, should receive
the accent3 as, parad-qut. This word would nothe
so pronounced‚ if simple, and why should it be -when
eompoundl (Roby, p. it; also Chap.13‚BookI.)

III. In Latin words, there are as many syllables as
there are, separate vowels and diphthongs.

o. A single consonant after an accented vowel must
be joined to it; as, pem-tot. This law is universal,
except in the Penult; after the vowel u; and also after
a, e,‘‚and o, when these vowels precede a consonant ·
followed by e, i, orp before another vowel; as, ho'·ra;
caasa-uteo do'-ce-o, atet-deor, pastui-ns, ord-ac-
tharac In all these exceptione, a mute with l orr ,
falls under the same rule as a single consonant; as
Oeno-irtel. In tibi andsiti the consonant must be
joined to the first vowels; tib-i, aih-i.
