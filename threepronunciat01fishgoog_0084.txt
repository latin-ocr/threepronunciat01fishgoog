nnn nnana raouuucramons on namn. 69

Were these diphthongs transmitted from the ancient
Latin as unintelligible as the whorls Sohliemann finds,
'as viewed in their relation to ancient Aryan customs‚
still historio piety must dictate their literal preservation.

The enigmas of the past are not to be trampled under
our feet, nor rudely pushed aside, as we know not what
revelatione may ultimately be made to ns through the
very perplexities to which they give nise.

The difference in regard to oe, indicated above, will
appear in pronounoing the word coelum.

Coelum=lruy-loom (u=vowel sound in rohirl). Blair.

Ocelum=lrcy·lcom (a=u in fate). Gildersleeve.

Coelum=lroylcom (oy=oi in coil). Tafel‚ etc.

Ocelum=lrowyloom (owy=orcy in charoy). Halde.

Again, notice the differenoe of opinion and usage in
regard to the letter v. The question among the new
“ Romans '’ is whether o shall be pronounoed like w or ,
nne tna gam-egra a unquesnonauy the differ-enee r
isa wide one, and rests mainly on diverse phonetio

theories. The two parties among the Romanists, rest· ¹

ing on diverse theories‚v have from the beginning held
their ground so tenaciously as to render agreement
simply impossible. Differenoe in theory, and also in
usage, is oonsessed by all scholars throughout the
world. Hence it seems wholly unnecessary to discuss
this point at any length. Those wishing to examine
the matter may refer to Roby’s Grammar, Peile's
Greek and Latin Etymology‚ and Prof. Twining's
article in “ Tm Western‚’' already mentioned. A very
briei examinaticn will verify the remark of A. J. Ellisr,
in his work on “ Early English Pronunciation'': “The
sound oso in ancient Latin is a matter of dispute.'’
