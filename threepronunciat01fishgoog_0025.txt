you would have thought, adds he, ‘thot nil Bubel hod
corne together.”' All those speaking were using the

Continenfal method. The variety among the natione
on tbe Continent is most graphically sketched in the
quotation from Eschenburg, himself among the ablest
of Enropean scholare. In the pronunciation of the
vowels there may be an approximate agreement, but in
the consonante there is the greatest diversity. English·
speaking people fumish the only anomalous, and we
must say the only humiliating, example of a great
nation literally ignoring its own and secking across the
Atlantic foreign sounds with which to pronounce this
grand old language. There might be reason in the
thing ifthe Continental nations had the true pronuncia·
tion, or, putting this supposition aeide, if they bad even
an approximate uniformity among themselves. As
matters now stand, the scholar who seeks the Conti-
nental mode, without defining accurately what variety
of it be wishes, is much like the rustic in his parsuit of
the will-o'-the·wisp.

How the native tongues on the Continent pronounee
Latin, after their own analogice, may be seen from a

g glance at the Romanos languages of Southern Europe,

the French, Italian, Portugnese, and Spanish, to which
the Latin stands in the relation of a common progen-
itor. The letteren, g, j, and u will be sufficient: -

FRENCH. ITALIAN.
