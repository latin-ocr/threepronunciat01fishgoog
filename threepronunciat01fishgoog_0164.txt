perfection‚'' say they. Very well. How? Is new
evidence to be dug up from the phonetic sepulchres of
the past? They do not expect this, nor claim it. How
then is harmony to be attained? We answer emphati-
cally it must come, if it come at all, hy conceaatur, by
compromise. Max Miiller proposes a compromise over
obesore e, i, y, ue, oe, und cu. A. J. Ellis proposes a

⁶ soul of the whole system, is soattered to the winds. A

conventional pronunciation, based on theory and com-
promise, in the nineteeuth century, will assuredly not
be the pronunciation oi the lucrarer Romans.

Some enthusiastic friends of the new method have
expressed surprise that aman of middle age should
cling to an old-fashioned pronunciatiou. In reply,

sacrifice his experience and judgment und the rich ’

experience of centurias to any new thing, unless it be
founded in stubborn facts and indisputable truth.
Whatever mode is used, let there be constant, striet,
