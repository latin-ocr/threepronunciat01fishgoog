Cicero, Kikero. But the name 01 Cicero has always
been a living name, familiario every ear in Italy, and
no one there ever heard it pronounced Kikero. It is
alleged, as an argument in favor of this pronunciation,
that it was spelled with the kappa, Kmapne, when
written in Greek. But supposing it were pronounced
by the ancient Romans, as ¹by the moderna, Chichero,
how were the Greeks with their alphahet 1ο represent
„this sound? They had no letter with which to spell it
nearer than kappa The chi was a deep guttural, the

kappa was the soit 10; they had no other letter, and - ,

they took the one nearest to it. , And, still more, do
we know what was the exact sound 01 the Greek
heppo? The same reasons also apply to the Greek
spelling 01 all similar names, such as Caesar and Celsus.
In fact, when we find Caius spelled Γαιος, one is
tempted to ask why the Γ is here used instead 01 the
kappa, 11 the heppo had the sound we suppose of our
own 10.- ·

“In like manner, in all ancient names 01 persons
and places in which p occurs before e'and 1, 11 is pro·
nounced soft hythe Italiam, and this affords one of
the strongest'proofs that it was so pronounced by the
Latina. As examples of this, among many othere,
may be cited virgime, Virginio‚ Girgente‚ Egisto,
Virgilio, Eugenio, Gemma, and Gelasio. Not only the
narrans give aa san sonna, which sen acueres to
these words even in English, but there is not one of
the Romance nations by whom 11 is pronounced hard.
The Spaniards aspirate it, and between French and·
Italians there is but a shade 01 difference, it being
softer in French, and having a slight sound 01 the z.
. No one pronounces it hard, like 9 in English pet.
