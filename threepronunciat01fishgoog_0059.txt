therefore, of some modern scholare to return to that
antiquated sound for oe, is not in conhict with thc
broadly marked general tendency of the Latin towards
a reduction of its diphthongo] sounds‚ but singularly
at vanance with the particular history of the diphthong
oe. The zeal of reform has impelled some to deny the
existence of any irregularity or obscurity in the Latin
pronunciation; but these cannot help us here, nor can
we adopt any such adventurous dogma as prescribes

some uniform s'ound by which in our practice to render
those words which. in printed texts furnished us, appear
written with the¹ signer, we must choose between the
sounds of ἒ, as in fetas, French, preire, or that of Ger·

post-classic Latin deserves to be heard ; and this speaks
for ἒ. On the other hand, the general turn taken by
oe into c, in the practice of the cultivated Romans of
the classica] period, establishes a good degree of proba·-
