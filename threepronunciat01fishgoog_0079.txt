01 e in met, still more prolonged than e in tres. He

speaks of sale as being “a convenient approximate ι

sound.'' In his “ International‚’' published in Decem·
ber, 1877, he gives e long=u in sate. Now we confess
our utter inability to understand how this able scholar,
· bytho prolongation of the sound of e in 1111, to any
extent, can reach as a result u in sate. Any oue can
test the matter by bringingto bear the organsof speech
on the production of the two sounds. Before the
speaker, when sounding ein met, cau produce the sound
of a insule, he must stop andreadjust the organs. The
trial will make manifest the truth that there is not only
a readjustment‚ but also a tension of the organs de-
cidedly greater iu sounding our genuine long o, which
almost all the Romans make the representative of the
long e, iu their system. Itis diluculum escape from
the conclusion that Prof. Richardson’s mind under·
went a change between October, 1876, and December.
1877, not only in reference to the long e, but also in
other particulars, as we may show hereafter.

But'to descend more to particulare, take the diph- .
thong m.

Roby says ae=u in bat (lengthened), or 110111.
Blair says oe=ai in'luir‚ or α in late.

Harkness says, ae=uye=llnglish i.
Gildersleeve says, ae=oe in Graeme=u in sume,

That the vowel sounds asheard iubat, lule, and uye=y
long, are not the same, is simply beyond all controversy(
We venture the assertion that no scholar, unless a for·
signer, who looks at the case calmly, will risk his repu-
tation as an orthoepist by affirming that these words do
contain the same· sound.
