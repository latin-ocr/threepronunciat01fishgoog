It must be obvious, therefore, to any considerate mind

7. But it may be urged that the use of the ausoauso
unrnon would render English-speaking Latinists masn-
nreiann ann ovsn run woarn. This argument would
come with great force, if founded on fact· daethano we
join issue withthe friendsof the new pronunciation. What
are the facts? These: no two natione in Europe pro-
nounce Latin alike3 the Roman method does not coin·
cide with a single system in Europe 3 and the American
or Englishman, with the hard sounds, would be as
unintelligible on the Rhine, Scine, and Tiber, as if he
used the English mode. More: in Italy the true pro·
nunciation, as it is called, would add harshncss to unin-
telligibility. For proof of what has just been attested‚'
let the scholar examine the sounds of the modern
languages‚ and particularly the consonante which make
articulate speech what it is.

For instance, there is awide difference in c, j, c,
between the Italian and the reformed system, as taught
in England and Germany : -

c=c, in Italian.

c=w, in German.

j=a vowel, in Italian.
j=y, in German.
