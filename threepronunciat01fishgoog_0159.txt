at last. Appeal to practice, far more valuabie in such
a ease than abstraot discussion. Charles B. Scott,
head master of the famous St. Peter’s College, West·

minster, England, whose letter has been given in chap-

, ter five, says, “In some [schools], no doubt, the .

change has been more or less sucoossiully made, hut
we found the waste of time involved in correcting mis·
pronunciation to be fatal. It is hard enough to teach

the various subjecta required in the hours which are ·

available‚ and if the Latin hours are to be spent in
mere vocal exercise, the language can never he learnt in
the time, nor the author studied. The change has
little value for mere boys.’' But, say the reformem,
the system is quite easy; the vowels differ only in
quantity, notin quality, oi sound, and these sounds are
quickly learned by the average boys3 the consonante, ,
with about seven exceptione, are like the English. A
conspectus oi the new system looks very easy indeed,
but it should be remembered that these boys, to be
accurate in the “ Roman '' in practice, must revolution·
ize their organs of speech and pronounce the vowels
and several of the consonants in a way totally different
from that to which they have been accustomed from
childhood. Lip habits, ¹lilre all others, are changed
with extreme difficulty and aiter much time has been
spent. Even then many of our Latinists, when the
test comes, may say sibboleth instead of siihholett.

In ¹this age, American and English boys have no
time to waste on foreign sounds in uttering Latin,

. especially when there is a scholarly pronunciation

familiar to them already.
