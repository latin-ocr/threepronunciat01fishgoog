Against the argument now under discussion in behalf
of the English system, Mr. Tetlow urges ε -—
“ Secondly, etymologias of this kind are so obvious,

from the twofold identity of form and sound, that they
are wholly devoid of interest. They require so little
ingenuity on the part of the student, as to be valueless
for purposes of philological training. They do not dis·
cipline the mind to the quick recognitiones kinship in

words that have undergone changes of form. What
school-bey, for example, does not find his curiosity more
stimulated in traoing the connection between the Latin
digitos and the French doiyt, than in traoing the deri·
ration from the Latin digitus of the English ἀφίῃ or

having thrael ethim the relationship between frigidas
and frigidi The kind of etymological training that this
argument would recommend is wholly distinct from
that which enables the pupil to appreciate the relationss
ship of such forms as the Greek οἶνος, the Latin uinum,
the English wine, and the Erench oia.’'

This quotation brings to the sursaoe the constantly

recurring fact, that the reformere forever, in· the defence ·
Δ of their theory, turn to comparative philology. Well
’ they may, for the “ Roman'' side, if it has any virtue

at all, can lay no claim to assistance in English etymol· ,

tinct from that which enables the pupil to appreciate
the relationship of such forme as the Greek οἶνος, the
Latin sinam, the English wine, and the French oin.’' ·
Indeed it is different, and the differenoe is founded

¹ largely in the plain home-truth that to see the relation

’ readily between our own words and the parent Latinis
of first and vital importance. Telling a class that'com·
