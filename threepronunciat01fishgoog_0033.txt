guished scholare who have written in favor of the
Roman method. But a system with such pretensions
must abide, as it professes to do, the results of the
crucible. Roby himself in his Prefaee says: “ An in·

nunciation which has not been uttered by an accredited
representative for the last serenteen' hundred years.''

pronunciatlon of educated men in one part of England

On what are these claime based?

1. The Latin grammarians: beginning with Verre,
64 Β. 0., and coming down 10 Priscianus Caesariensis,
who taught 01 Constantinople, 570 A. D. In reference
to these grammarians‚ Prof. Blair, in his introduction,
saysz “To whose instructions we must now turn, iu

²‚order to gather by inference‚ aud not without great
care and pains, the information which might have been
easily and more certainly had by spending 00 honr with

Ι the Roman boys 10 their elementary school.”

2. The information gleaned from grammarians is
compared with three sources 01 probable proof.

(α) The traditione of scholare end the modern Rc-
manic languages.

(b) The Greek mode of rendering Latin scnnds into
their tongue. The Greeks attempted to imitate the
Latin sounds as perfectly as their letters would allow.

(c) The third probable proof is “ the faee of the lan·
guage isselt, as seen 10 its records which have been pre·
served 10 00.”
