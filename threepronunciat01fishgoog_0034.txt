For these three positione reference may be made to
s Prof. Blair’s work, one of the best yet published on this '
subject iu America.

Α source of testimony much relied on by Roman
Latinists is the modern Romance languages of Southeru
Europe,-a point which shall receive proper attention
as we proceed.

But what kind of evidence is it upon which these
lofty claims are based? The auswer is, and must in
the nature oi the case be, “Probable evidence.''

It is not at all our design in this discussion to under· .

value probable or moral evidence. Far from it.

The countless facts of history, oi the sciences, and
of Christianity itself rest on this kind of proof.

The human mind is so constituted as to rest with as
much confidence in probable evidence ol the degree of
moral certainty as in demonstrative or mathematical
evidence. We do not object to the socalled Roman
method becouae its basis is moral evidence, as from the
nature of the case it can admit of no other kind, but
because it is destitute of that measure of evidence of
this kind which would entitle it to our acceptance3 and
our critios who drew a contrary meaning from our
words fell into very strange misapprehensions of state·
ments designed to be plain to all, viz. :-

Probable evidence presente various degrees oi
strength. In the lowest form, it warrants only pre·
sumptiou3 in the highest degree, it warrauts moral cer·
tainty. In the face oi the conflicting opinions and
difficulties to be shown hereafter‚ no scholar cau make
the least pretension that the resurrected system rests
on any such basis as moral certainty. Far from it. Ι
