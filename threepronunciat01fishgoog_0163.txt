without loss of time. One of New England’s great

understood that we do not concede its claime. No
man living can tell how the Romans pronounced their
language. The Romanists tell us we must value truth
because it ie truth, and that error'is pernleious because

than is furnished by the defendere oi the innovation.
So far from the system resting on a basis of truth, the
want of harmony among its supporters discredits the
evidence adduced in its behali, and rendere uniformity
oi practice impossible. “But they are going on to
