orthography from 64 to 117 Α. Ι)., and, oi course, the
best exhibition of the phonetics of the Romans. But
this very orthography has caused no little trouble, and
the matter is not yet settled, and consequently, the ¹
phonetics depending on the spelling cannot possibly
be determined. What becomes of Cicero, when such
changes were made in orthography in a hundred years?
Even if we had the spelling and phonetics of the post·
Augustan age definitely fixed, there, may be a serious
barrier still between us and the phonetics of the Golden
Age. Brambach says: “At the beginning of this
period (100 B. C.), the Latin language, as is frequently
evidenced by the texts of these authors, was in process ¹
of a rapid development in respect to forms.” With a
view to distinguish the usage of these writers in the
matter of pronunciation and orthography, we may ,
divide them into three groups.

Taking the whole case as it lies before us, especially
in view of the rapid changes in spelling and necessarily
in the phonetics of words, as indicated above, we can ·
see at a glanae that it is no easy matter to decide how
Cicero, Caesar, and Horace pronounced Latin.
