parative philology is valuable and interesting does not
prove that athorough and intelligent knowledge of
their own etymology is not valuable and interesting.
With most studente, their own tongue is infinitely the
most important.

“But, tln'rdly, not only is the kind o'f etymological
discipline, which Prof. Fisher so highly commends,
uninteresting in its processes and barren in its results,
but it is not seldom positively misleading. It has be-
gotten in the past a tendency to build fanciful and·
false etymologies on mere superficial resemblances, and
has caused works that were once thought to be sacred
and permanent repositories of philological tuith, to be
looked upon as whitcd sepulchres in which philological

· error lies buried. These are no longer weleomed as

trusted guides in classical study; they are now rejected
as dangerous companions.'' ¹

Here the author last quoted urges that using that
system of pronouncing Latin which makes the deriva-
tion of our words most obvious is “ uninteresting and
barren ln its results'’ This assertion from an English·
speaking scholar is surely both ill-omened and start-
ling. He seems to think that English etymology as
touching the classic Latin is so easy as to require no
' skill for such a> barren and uninteresting field of
inquiry.

“English is not a languagc which teaches itself by
mere unreflecting usage. It can only be mastered‚ in
all its wealth, in all its power, by conscious, persistent

· labor; and therefore, when all lue world is awaking to

¹ the value of generalphilological science, it would ill

' become us to be slow in recognizing the special impor· ,
¹ tanae of our own tongue.’' - Morslr’s Lectores of anq-
