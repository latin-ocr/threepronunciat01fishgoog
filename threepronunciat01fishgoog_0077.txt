March, the essential idea os a phonetic alphabet3 this,
then, is conceded to be our criterion of judgment.
Haldeman‚ quoting with approral Gr. Walher, says:
‘⁶ Every letter retained an invariable sound.” Quoting
from Scheller, he says: “The sound 01⁰ the long and
short vowels‚ though elementorily the come, were always ·
distinguished in length.'' (Haldeman's Latin Pronun-
ciation, pp. 17, 19.) Allen and Greenough say, “By
the Roman (or phonetic) method‚ every letter lasa al-
ways tlre come couad.” (Gramma, p. 7.) These are
explicit statements of what is held hythe new ‘⁴ Ro·
mans ” throughout the world. The vowels did differ in
quantity, they did not differ in quality.
Haldeman holds that: -

 

l
l

a=a in arm. a=a in art. Ι l
e=ey in they. ‹i=ei in eight. ³
v

i=iin marine. i=i in deceit.
o=o in own. 6==o in obey.
’ 1⁸1=oo in fool. ri=u in full.

Here, in this ideal scheme‘, the phonetic theory is
substantially carried out. ³

Compare with this Tafel's scheme, which is identical‚
at least professedly sc, with that of Corssen. ⁵

a=a in father. 'a=same sound shorter.
e=a in fate. ὅτε in then.

i=i in machine. ⁴ i=i in sit. ⁸
o=oin hole. ti=o in nor.

i1=u in rude. ai=u in put.

N A glauce at this ideal scheme will show that it is not
ζ consistent with the theory in the short sounds of e, ι’, ο,
1.''!*andu' E in ilaec, i in eit, ο in aar, and u in put have
