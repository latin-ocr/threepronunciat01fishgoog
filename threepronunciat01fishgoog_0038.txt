Tho difficulty here is seen and felt and confessed ,hy'
scholars whose vast researches in the field of philology
in the last twenty-five years have been simply amazing‚
and have crowned with honor the countries to which
they belong. Fortunately there is in the Hebrew lan·
guage a ready and vivid illustratlon of the obstacles to
be overcome in determining the true pronunciation of
an ancient language. Jews and Christiane, of all
names and all shades of belief, have stood as sleepless
sentinels over this tongue oi the old prophets for over
eighteen centuries. But what is true today? There
are three distinct systems of pronunciation now current
among the Jews themselves, to say nothing of Gentile
nations. These are the Polish, German, and Portu·
guese methods. Dr. Alexander Meyrowit2,* of the
University oi Mlssomis'aJ'e'wsandone of the greatest
Hebrew and Rabbinical scholare now living, lays down
these systems in the Preface to his Hebrew Grammar.
Look at the illustration thus afforded. The Hebrew
has ior thousands of years heen a spoken and living
language. It is so today. The Jews, over seven
millions in nmnber, are found in every nation under
heaven, clinging, too, with startling tenacity, to the
customs, traditione, sacred books, and language of their
fathers. In the fifth century, or at the latest in the
seventh, Jewish scholars invented the vowel points to
avoid “losing the correct pronunciation.” (Conant's
Gesenius,p. 38.) Further still. Alongside the Hebrew
stands its cognate, the Arabio, a tongue spoken by
hundreds of millions for untoldgenerations. The Jews

*Da Meyrowitz speaks Hebrew as we speak English, and
is called among the Jews the “ Hebrew Horace.”
