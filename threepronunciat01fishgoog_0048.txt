language of the educated Greeks is not the traditional
language of the Greek nation, for in its present form
it had no existence a century ago. The modern Greek,
properly so called, is in reality the legitimate offspring
ὀἳ the Byzantine Greek, the last and most corrupt
stage of the common Attic, and however ancient some
of its peculiarities may be, its chief characteristics can·
not be critically traced farther back than the times of
Theodorus Ptochoprodromus (A, Ι). 1150), the first
Romaic author of whom we have any definite accounts.
The modern method began to attract the attention of
American scholars upwards of thirty years ago. Much
hasbeen written in its favor. In general, however, it
has been treated with contemptor indifference, not, as
one might hastily suppose, because its sounds are
meagre and effeminate, nor because it is not the pro-
nunciation os at least four millions of Greeks scattered
all over the East, but simply because its defenders have
failed to estabhsh its claims to classical antiquity.”*

Now, even at the risk os a slight repetition, we would
fix attention on the fact that the modern Greeks do not
possess the true ancient pronunciation, according to
Sophocles, himselfa modern Greek, again, that, on the
authority os Profs. Blackie, Kendrick, and others,
the Erasmian is not the classic pronunciation3 and
lastly, that, as shown from the following quotation
from Sophocles, the true ancient pronunciationis not
known and cannot be known, and that too from tho
nature of the case: -

“ It is conceded that the refinements of the classioal
pronunciation cannot be determined with precision, ‚
partly because they are not minutely described by

*Sophocles
