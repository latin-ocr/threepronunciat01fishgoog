the Latin. Can such words long retain their present
pronunciation against the united, though perhaps un·
conscious and involuntary inclination of all educated
men who speak English? For we think it must be the
tendency os those who become familiar with the pro·
posed·pronunciation of Latin, to extend it to English v
words which are nearly identioal in form with Latin
words, and are identical with them in meaning: and
the more familiar such persons are with the former, the

answers this argument thus: “ Tho words that belong

quite independently of special movements among
scholars.’' But scholars are not the only ones to have
influenoe in this case. There are multitudes oi stu-
dents of both sexes whose power will be as effectus] as
that os the writer or teacher. Let the thousands of
students of Latin in America to=day he taught the new
method, and the danger to our own tongue from the
harsh and hard sounds of the so·called phonetic mode
would bc amazingly increased. This is true not only
in tho abstruct but in the concrete There are students
in this university at this hour whose English is marred
by having been taught the innovation. The same is
true in other places.
