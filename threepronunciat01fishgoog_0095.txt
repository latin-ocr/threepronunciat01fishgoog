These articles of Mr. Tetlow have been written with-
in two months past3 they present the new system in
its most plausible phase and furnish us, in the quota·
tious made, an answer to Prot. Haldeman's plea sor the
x new system, that leaves nothing to he desired in addi·

Χ tion. Α Frenohman can’t learn English from books,

aad especially its phonetics3 an American can't learn
French from books; and no man living can learn the
phonetics oi the ancient Latin from books. Is not
t'rom books, where is he to go? Let some New ‘⁶ Ro-
· man ’' tell us.

Take one more illustration. Prot. W. G. Richard-
· son, under date of May 3, in the “Columbia States·
man,'' says: ‘⁶ Prot. Leonard must anglicize his speech
to com-ment vowss por-tea vowss. . Ihave

. alitepary friend who actually pronounoes thus. He

learned ‘French without a master.' Fortunately he is
very deas and knows little of the effectos his peculiar
phonetics.'' The reformers are thoroughly sound when
they handle any other language than the Latin. The
two illustratione just made exhibit vividly how near we

can approach the phonetics of alanguage from books
alone. ’
