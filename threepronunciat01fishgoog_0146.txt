culum is at once revolutionized and caricatured by being
pronounced ceddam ab tuyer-tee-ola abd turbe-toccu wape-
treecoo-loom. These words have not been selected for
their strangeness‚ but because they give a fair indication
of the confusion that the so-called Roman would intro-
duce into this learned profession. Who can believe that
physicians in England and America will adopt such an
innovation?

So far for Anatomy and Physiology3 but Materia
Medica demands a notice.
