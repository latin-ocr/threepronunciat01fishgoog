’ now offered for acceptanee‚ is not to be charged with
all the diversities which appeared when the views of
scholars were crude and tentative.'' Surely a coep ,
de grace that, and frema Romanist too. Hear him ’
further: “ Ten years ago Prof. Thaeher might call ate

Richardson, wrote in 18593 Taiel, in 1860; their
