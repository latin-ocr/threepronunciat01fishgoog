pronunciation of these letters in such positions must
have been the same, or nearly the same, and therefore
that c could not have been pronounced as lc. Thac, sola·
tium, convitium, suspitio, tribunitius, nuntiae, conditio,
among others, are otton spelled solacium, convicium,
suspicio, tribunicius, nuncius, condicio. A still stronger
evidence of this is to be found in the ancient names of
persons. There would seem to be no safer method of
determining the ancient pronunciation of letters than
by a recurrence to the proper names in which they are
to be found. Names alter little, if at all, for centuries.
They are in constant use, and handed down in hundreds
and thousands of families from one to another genera-
tion. The sound is constantly on the tongue and on

’ the ear, and is subject naturally to less variation than

in any other words. The first mispronunciation of it
would be saluted with laughter. Even were the spell-
ing lost, the pronunciation would romain Now, among
the ancient names c is constantly used interchangeably

a with t, showing that these two letters were in such

cases nearly, if not exactly, equivalents in sound.
Thus, among others, Marcia is sometimes spelled
Martia3 Mucius, Mutius3 Neratius, Neracius3 Portia,

have always been in use in Italy. Is it possible to a

believe that the present pronunciation of these names
in Italy, which* have been in constant, familiar use in
hundreda of familias for twenty centurias at least, is
entirely false? When did it suffer this change? Why
