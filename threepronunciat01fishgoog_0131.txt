Prof. Huldemsnsays, “ Sounds eud not letters furnish
the material for etymology.'’* This is true, and we
wish no better basis ior our present argument. The r
English method assists the student, even in his early
Latin course, in his etymology; und the derivation of
wordS, in a multitude oi instanees, becomes manifest
from the very pronunciation itseli. Tske the word
circumjacent, for example, irom eirmcmjueeo. Pro-
nounoing this word by the English method, sur-eum-
ju-se·0, at once reveels to the pupil the origin of eir·
cumjaceut. The likeness is olear even to a ohild. ·

But pronounee the same word by the Roman ‚

system, end circuusjueeo becomes seer-eoom-yah-ueo!
The connection oen be seen only by adveneed scholers,
, and is very likely not seen then. Take the words rup-
ture, rustic, sociul, meministine, from ruptum, rusticus,
socius, and ruminatio. When these Latin words are
pronounoed by the English mode the origin os the word,
is olear3 but let the Latin be pronounoed resp-tuom,
roos-teeooos, so-lcee-ooss, and roo-meeuuh-teeo, end
the origin is obseured by foreign sonnds. Try uioiutty,
vital, citatius, equutioo, etoil, und equity, from vicinitus,
uitalis, citatio, aequatis, ciuilis, and nequitus. The
English mode reveals the truth, for “ sounds furnish the
material for etymology.'' Apply the so-oalled Roman
and say mee-lueeoee-tuhs, mee-tuhleess, hee-tatere, aye·
lculi-teos, lese-wee-leess, und oye-luee-tuhs, und English
etymology is offered a sacrifice to a revolutionary inno·
vation. Again, look ut the common verhal stems jue,
“ nul, dio, (luo, pel, and so on through the list. When·
ever these stems ooeur in our lunguage, the English
