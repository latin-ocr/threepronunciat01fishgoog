4. The argument against the pronunciation of clil're
lc, that apparently has the most force, is the confusion
in words that end in -cio and -fio ,· but this, too, really
is groundless, at least for high Latin, because the
confusion was not one of sonnd, but of the different ’
suffixos oio, 3tic ; and this confusion was of alate date.
The earliest example we have of -tio for -ct‘o was in
A. D. 192-211 (Corssem 1. 50-67), and there are
only seven instances of -ci for -u‘ in inscriptions before
the seventh century of our era· (Roby's Lat. Grum,

Mommsen, in his notes on Livy, p. 175, says=
“Nunquam in libro Veronensi commutatas reperies
littorasc et f, quod qui ante septimum saeculum ob·
tinuisse sibi persuadent, ne ii vehementer errant.'’ Of
these seven inscriptions, three are given by collectore
who lived when the false spelling had become usual;
one is from a notoriously bad speller; another is from
an inscription containing many misspelt words, and
the remaining two are from an Astacon inscription of
about A.‘1). 230. And even if these last two be rightly
copied, it is absurd to lay down a rule for the spelling
or pronunciation of aword in Cicero’s time, from the
spelling of the same word in a time when Latin had
fallen, and could hardly sven be called classicall But y
even supposing this confusion existed, does it really
prove anything? We have examples in many languages
where t and lt are habitually eonfounded; one will suf· ¹
