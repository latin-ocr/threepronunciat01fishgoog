If the kind of etymologioal study now under discus·
sion is barren and uninteresting, why should Prul'.
Marsh say that the wealth and power of the English is
not to be mastered without ‘⁶ conscious and persistent
labor''? Mastering English etymology is one of the
most difficolt duties before the American student and
scholar. For instance, fection, fiction, effare, imperfect,
defective, officer, efficaciores, beneytoiol, coanimati, prurit,
»iadefeueibla on the authority of Prot. Haldeman, are
all built on the root suc. Is this easily seen by a nov·
ice iu Latin? Can it be easily seen by our Latin in·
structors? Do such results llash out by intuitioni
How many teachers, even in our best schools, have ever
known them?

So far is the etymologieal study we recommend from
being “barren and uninteresting,'' that we may safely
affirm that not one hundred scholare in America can
lay claim to anything like superior excellence in Eng-
lish etymology. 'This statement will force itsell' on ,ἱ
every one who cares to examine Haldeman’s “Ety- ,
mology,’' and his “Affixes to English Words.'’ Instead a„
of being too easy, traoing our words back correotly
often escapes the occupant of the professor’s chair;
instead os being uninteresting, it can be made thrillingly
interesting, and that, too, to the highest classes in
¹ American colleges and universities; instead of being
barren, it brings the richest offering that can be laid
on the altar oi genuine scholarship.

The truth is that the argument we have set forth as
the first one in defence of the English system has

never been answered in either England or America, ι

and that for the simple reason that it cannot be an·
swered. We might rest the case with this argument,

but there aree others.
