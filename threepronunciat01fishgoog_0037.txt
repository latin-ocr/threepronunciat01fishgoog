or our own, that every one of them runs like a thread
through every page, and constitutos an important ele·
ἡ ment of it. The· difficulties which attend this subject
ure inherent in it, are such that there is no nation in
Europe, the classica] scholare of which agree in claim-

Roman forum, or in attempting to do so.'' Haldeman,
on page 18 ο1 his “Afflxes to English Words,’' says, ·
“The Latin alphabet is composed of the following
twenty letters‚’' naming them, aud holding that only
uine, B, D, F, H, N, P, Q, T, X, had the same power
as in English. But suppose there is cuc sound, like the
diphthong oc or oe, running “like a thread through
every page‚” and in a multitude of words, which is not
known and about which there is a variety of opinions,
will any man affirm that we know the pronunciation
of a language when this multitude of words contains
. an unknown or at least aperplexing and unsettled
sound, and yet eleven unknown sounds are conceded?
Let us now notice closely some of the difficulties sur·

1. Tlun. Rohy tells us that it is a ‘⁴ pronuncia-

tion that has not been uttered by an accredited repre· ι

sentative'’ for seventeen hundred years. The task
¹ before the reformare, therefore, is to thread their way
back through the phoneticlabyrinth of fifty generations,
and truce with accuracy the pedigree ofthe Latin sounds.
Let it be borne clearly in mind thatin the so-called
Roman mode the phonetic clement is absolutely uitat ;
the sounds of the uowels differ in qrruuttly, but never in
qualityss Haldeman holds that “ a long vowel (or
syllable) is twice the length of a short oue, aud has the
same quality.’' (Affixes, p. 19.)
