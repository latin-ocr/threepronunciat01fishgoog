does not the writer know that all these Greek proper
names in our lexicons are pronounced universally and
invariably, in both England and America, according to
theold-fashioned English? Noonecaubelievethatthese
’ able Roman Latinists have allowed the fact here alluded
toto escape them. And yet the quotation above might
lead a student to suppose that these Greek names were

pronounced after the method of pronouncing Greek ⁴

'now commonly received in this country. We mean

the Erasmian. The truth is that not a single proper > ¹

name in Webster or Worcester is prouounced accord·

And so of the rest.

Again, the author of the quotation makes the wholly ’
gratuitous assumption that “ probably not two hundred ²'
of those names are of frequent occurrence. Will it not
be hard tc induce a thorough scholar, who has taken
anything like a thorough course in our best schocls, to
believe that only two hundred names out of a list of over
twenty thousand are of importance on account of fre-
queucy? One hour's work in Webster’s Dictionary, by

⁴ one who is conversant with the classic tongues, will dis-

sipate quite effectually all such arguments. There are

over 'fifty proper names on the very first pege of Web-
ster that are of decided importance to our college classes.
But even if comparatively few were of frequent occur-
renco, we insist that an accurate knowledge of the
