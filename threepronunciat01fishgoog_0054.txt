must necessarily have been changed, as in “ audacter ’'
for ‘⁸ audaciter.'' This would have taken place, too,
in an enormously large number of other words; e. 9.,
difficulter and difficile3 capio and oepi; cano and '
cecini; acer and aoris3 locus and loci; lacus and laci,
with the two datives lacibus and lacubus; piscis and
piscosus, etc. ’

2. Quintilian says (I. 7, 10), “ Κ quidem in nullis

‘ verbis utendum puto, nisi quae significat, etiam ut sola
ponatur. Hoc eo non omisi, quod quidam eam, quo·
tiens A sequatur, neeessariam creduut, oum sit Ο
littera, quae ad omnes vocales vim suam perferat.''
K, we know, was used in certain word, as Kalends,
Karthago, otc. Now there was a very animated dis·
cussion among grammarians in Quintilian's time, as to
whether the Roman alphabet needed more letters or
already had too many. Vide carna, Ι. 4, 7-9. He
there instances le and q.

Terent. Maurus (about 300 Α. 1).) speaks also
about these letters, and says that lo and q are both use-
less, sinee lo, q, or ccan be used alter any vowel with
the same sound. <Vss204-209). Iquote merely the
last line, “refert nihilum, lc prior an q siet an o.'’
Again, Priscian (Ι. page 12) says, “lc enim et q,
quamvis figura et nomine videantur aliquam habere dif-
ferentiam, cum c tamen eadem tam in sono vocum
quam in metio potestatem continent.''

3. In transcribing Greek and Latin words kappa is
always written for c, and uice versu ; whereas, in some
words, as Cicero, for instance, would have been much
nearer the sound, if c had been pronounced soft3 or in .
many instances could have been used as in the above
example of Cicero
