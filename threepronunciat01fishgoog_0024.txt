One of the chief argumentator the adoption of what
scholare strangely enough call the Continental system,
has been that it would enable learned men, by means
of acommon pronunciation, to make themselves intel·

German States. What has just been said is a sample
of an actual state of facts as existing on the Continent
at this hour. Eschenburg, on page 550 of his “ Clas-
