classica] corruptions, and as being preferable in prac-
tice to such intermediate sonnds 00 English organs do
not easily makel’* Ἠο10 the want 01 harmony insisted
on, 1000111000οᾶ, and a change in practice is frankly
admitted. How does Prof. W. G. Richardson meet
the difficulty? Here is his answer: “ Oe 10 not worth a
pinch oi Napoleon’s suuis, especially since our revised
orthography has expunged it from those oftrecurring ¹
² words eoelum, poenitet, coeno, 010.” Truly, this modern
Alexander wields a Damascus blade in cutting his
Gordian knots in the Latin pronunciation. If the
reformers can only eliminate oe from the languuge‚ then
truly this one difficulty has been removed. Will Mayor
and Roby‚ Haldeman and Blair, and 0111010, meet a
difficulty in 11110 way? We venture a decisivo negative.
But Ptof. Richardson (“ Courier Journal,” April)
says: “ Abrandnew type 01 philology has been let
. loose on this planet, 0 thing 01 1110 and joy forever.'’
“ Υο0, and an infinite pity it has been 101 10000 01 all, 11 “
Nic proposes 10 remove difficulties in the way indicated
111010. This accomplished linguist does uot propose
to settle all disputed' questions in this manner. It
may he, however,· that this is a philologieal pleasantry.
The truth 01 history entitles us toexpeet 01 antiquari·
ans that the monuments 01 the past shall nothe mutila-
, ted or transmuted so 00 10 respond 10 modern notions,
as thereby their actual value as reaching monuments 10
destroyed.
Schliemann does not venture to change the relies he
finds in Hissarlilr or Mycenae, but simply reports them
00 they are, whether he understands 'them or not.
