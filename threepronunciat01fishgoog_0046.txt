THE rHssu PRONUNCIATIONS OF burm. 31 ·

Basle, in the year 1528, his famous dialogue entitled
‘⁴ De recta Latini, Graecique sermonis pronuntiatione.''
The text on which that masterly review was based,
from beginning to end, was, ‘⁶ Nunc tota fere pronuntia·
tio depravata est tam apud Graecos, quam apud Lati·
nos.” Oi this text, John Stuart Blackie, Professores
Greek in the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, one of
the most distinguished scholars now living, says: “This
is proved in a very exhaustive style in an argument
extending to above two hundred pagos. The powers os
the different letters are critically discussed, and the
“ relation of secent and quantity illustrated both by
learned rules and by living examples. With regard to
the vowel sounds‚ which is the first point handled, he
had an easy task to prove that the slender sound, the
characteristic of the Byzantius Greeks, could not have
been the original sound of so many distinct vowels and
diphthongs. Sigus of different vowels are certainly not
’ made originally to confouud, but to distinguish. The
confusion in this case is always of a later birth. What
Erasmus, however, failed in here, and what, from want
of materials, he could not but fail in, wasto show at
what period this confusion commenced, . . . and
the result was that, by this assault of Erasmus, the
faith of scholare in the orthoepic traditions of ,the
Byzantius elders was shaken in all the most learned
countries of Europe, and every nation set up vocalizing
Greek according to what seemcd good in its own eyes.
Hence the motley babblement of Greek which now
prevails.’' ⁴³
